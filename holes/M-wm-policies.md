## 1. IDENTIFY

### Motivation

The War Machine currently scores **single next-steps** — it ranks `pursue mission M` as if each mission
were one atomic action — and picks the minimum-EFE one. Two consequences, both live as of 2026-06-09:

1. **The visible symptom:** the WM's top recommendation is `open-mission M-emacs-cursor-peripheral`
   (G=−9.25), long noted to be a silly pick. The diagnosis (§2) shows *why*: the "advance the capability
   map" credit is currently **anti-functional** — it buries every on-map mission at the bottom and lets
   off-map work fill the entire top.
2. **The structural issue Joe named:** the WM should **select over policies (sequences of steps), not
   just next steps**. Scoring a mission by its *whole remaining size* is the single-step-vs-policy
   confusion already biting at the one-step level.

These are the same issue at two depths. This mission fixes the one-step credit (the easy cleanup) **and**
charters the policy layer (the bigger build).

### The two tracks

- **Track 1 — cleanup (easy, do now):** repair the graph-EFE term so on-ascent work outranks off-map
  junk. Still single-step EFE. Demonstrated fix in hand (§3). De-risked via the regulator sweep, applied
  live with operator consent.
- **Track 2 — the policy layer (the mission's reason to exist):** generalize "score the next leaf" to
  "score a *policy* = a sequence of leaves," rolled out over a transition model. Gated on a
  field-simulator (no fabricated dynamics — the regulator's lesson). The two pieces are in flight:
  claude-3's substrate-2/Salingaros field + claude-4's arrows. The join is a **forward-model contract**.

### Theoretical anchoring

- **Active inference over policies:** EFE is properly `G(π)` over policies `π`, not over single actions.
  The WM's one-priority selector is the degenerate one-step case. The exploit pole (pragmatic/risk) and
  explore pole (epistemic/info) both accumulate over the rollout.
- **AlphaZero mapping ([[M-futonzero-capability]] §22):** policy = patterns/arrows, value =
  EFE-over-play-outs, search = strategy, reward = peradam/Dokusan. "No perfect simulator" is dissolved
  by "patterns are invariant-enough" — but the rollout still needs a *field* to roll over.
- **Regulator lesson ([[E-possible-world-regulator]]):** don't fabricate dynamics. The field-simulator
  must be real (claude-3's substrate-2), not invented, or the rollout scores fiction.

### Theoretical correction — EFE is a path functional, not a field (Joe, ratified 2026-06-09)

EFE is a property of **policies**, so `G(π)` is a **path integral** — a functional over the
trajectory-distribution a policy induces — **not** a scalar field over states. A field assigns a value to
each *point*; `G(π)` assigns a value to each *path*. The same map node sits on many policies with
different `G`, so a node does not *own* an EFE: "colour each node by its EFE" is a category slip. Three
objects get conflated under "the EFE field":

- **`g(s)` — the per-step integrand.** A legitimate field: the local cost / **Lagrangian density**
  (claude-3's substrate-2 `C`/holes + my per-step graph-ascent). Fine to render — but **not** EFE.
- **`G(π)` — the policy EFE.** The path integral of `g` over the policy's trajectory. The quantity we
  minimise. **Not a field.**
- **`V(s)` — optimal cost-to-go.** *Is* a scalar field over states — but only as the **output** of
  solving the path-minimisation (Bellman value), obtained by doing the integral, not read locally. This
  is the "can be seen as a field" case.

**Why this is the heart of the mission.** The field view is exact *only* for length-1 policies, where
`G(π) = g(s₁)`. Today's WM is exactly that — `argmin` over single-step actions of a per-state proxy.
**The cursor bug is the field worldview drawn as a picture: greedy-pointwise over a heatmap.** Track 2
(policies, length > 1) *is* the move from field to path integral; past length 1 the field view becomes
the error, not the answer.

**Metric / geodesic reframing (generative).** substrate-2's `C` is the local **metric** (Lagrangian
density); `G(π)` is the **action / path-length** in that metric; policy selection is **geodesic-finding**
— the least-EFE *path*, not the lowest-metric *point*. Consequences:
- **Render naming:** the `g(s)` heatmap is the **metric backdrop** — name it the *per-step cost / metric
  field*, **not** "the EFE field." The *figure* is the **geodesic**: selected policies drawn as
  trajectories/streamlines, ranked by `G(π)`. A heatmap read greedily is the very thing Track 2 exists
  to stop.
- The two-kinds-of-off-map finding (§4) is the same insight from the goal side: an unminted goal is an
  **endpoint with no terrain** — no geodesic can reach it; the path must first be built by chartering a
  minting mission.

### Scope in
- Fix `graph-efe-terms` (off-map escape hatch + body granularity) — Track 1.
- Regulator-sweep the fix across the whole field; apply live with consent.
- Charter + spec the policy rollout — Track 2 — including the forward-model contract.

### Scope out
- Building the field-simulator itself (claude-3's substrate-2 / D2-full-C lane).
- Building the arrow/transition structure (claude-4's M-memes-arrows-patterns-diagrams).
- Changing the gap term, the consent gates, or the survival/structural-pressure terms (separate).

### Completion criteria
1. The live WM no longer ranks off-map junk above on-ascent work (the cursor is demoted; an on-ascent
   mission or leaf takes #1), verified on the live judgement — Track 1.
2. The off-map-penalty + leaf-aware-body settings are **swept** (robust across the field, not a hand
   guess), recorded in the regulator, applied to the live opts with operator consent — Track 1.
3. A forward-model contract exists that claude-3's field and claude-4's arrows can both target — Track 2.
4. A policy rollout (≥2 steps) scores a sequence and beats the equivalent greedy one-step pick on at
   least one case where they differ — Track 2 (the policy-selection witness).

## 2. MAP — the live diagnosis (grounded 2026-06-09)

Source: live judgement via `futon3c.peripheral.war-machine-pilot/live-judgement`, 88 candidates.

**The graph term is anti-functional.** `graph-efe-terms` (efe.clj:111-137) computes
`:G-graph-pragmatic = applicability + body − ascent`, where `body = graph-body-weight × open-hole-count`.
The **else-branch (efe.clj:134-137) gives off-graph actions a flat `0.0`.** Live consequence:

- **All 12 of the top-12 ranked actions are off-map** (`:G-graph-pragmatic 0.0`).
- **The first on-map mission sits at rank 83 of 88.** (11 on-map candidates, 77 off-map.)
- The cursor (`M-emacs-cursor-peripheral`): rank 1, G −9.25, graph-prag **0.0**, gap 5.25, ascent 0.

**On-map breakdown (sorted by G-total) — the body penalty swamps the ascent credit:**

| mission | G-total | body | ascent | gap | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M-hypergraph-operator | −6.25 | 0 | 0 | 2.25 | best on-map, but ascent 0 |
| M-arxana-roundtrip | −6.21 | 0 | 0 | 2.20 | |
| M-essay-corpus-substrate | −2.31 | 3 | 0 | 1.30 | only `single-cycle-leaf? true` |
| M-war-machine-pilot | **+20.29** | **27** | 2 | 0.70 | **on-ascent, buried by body** |
| M-capability-star-map | **+21.60** | **30** | 3 | 1.40 | **on-ascent, buried by body** |
| M-stack-geometry | +66.00 | **72** | 0 | 2.00 | body penalty alone = +72 |

### The two coupled bugs
- **(a) Off-map escape hatch.** Not being on the capability graph scores `0`. Off-map work is *free*;
  on-map work is *taxed*. This inverts the ARGUE principle ("if it doesn't advance the map, it's not
  worth doing").
- **(b) Body penalty is the wrong granularity.** `body = weight × total-open-hole-count` penalizes a
  mission's *whole remaining size* as if completed in one step. The two `ascent>0` missions are ranked
  *worst* of all on-map. **This is the single-step-vs-policy confusion in miniature** — you don't do a
  whole mission in a step, you take its next *leaf* (`:graph/single-cycle-leaf?` is already computed).

> **Correction to [[M-capability-star-map]] Basecamp fan-out §1.1.** Pilot #1 *hypothesised* the live
> caller omits `:capability-graph` from opts (so only `:G-gap` ranks). The live check **refutes** that:
> `:opts-have-graph? true`, and the marking-rule *is* firing (`ascent-progress 0.5`). The real bug is
> (a)+(b) above, not a missing graph. Verify-before-claim earned its keep.

## 3. DERIVE

### Track 1 — the cleanup steps (easy; demonstrated)

**Demonstrated fix (sandboxed re-ranking over the live numbers, no live change):** with (a) an off-map
penalty `P` and (b) the whole-mission body term dropped —

| P | new #1 | new #2 | cursor rank |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | M-capability-star-map (on-ascent) | M-war-machine-pilot (on-ascent) | 4 |
| **4** | **M-capability-star-map** | **M-war-machine-pilot** | **9** |
| 5 | M-capability-star-map | M-war-machine-pilot | 9 |

At P≈4 the top-5 become all on-map, the two `ascent>0` missions take #1/#2, and the cursor sinks to 9.

**Cleanup checklist:**
1. **Close the off-map escape.** In `graph-efe-terms` else-branch (efe.clj:134-137), replace
   `:G-graph-pragmatic 0.0` with an off-map penalty, gated by a new opt `:graph-off-map-penalty`
   (default `0.0` to preserve current behavior — additive, safe).
2. **Make the body term leaf-aware.** Replace `body-weight × total-open-hole-count` with a *next-step*
   cost: reward/score the next single-cycle leaf (the `:graph/single-cycle-leaf?` flag exists) rather
   than penalize whole-mission size; gate by opt (e.g. `:graph-body-mode :whole | :leaf`, default
   `:whole` to preserve behavior).
3. **Make ascent status-aware** (hard requirement from the forward-model contract v1, below).
   `mission-ascent-progress` must yield **zero** credit for capabilities already `:satisfied` — only
   not-yet-satisfied capabilities in the goal's transitive scope count. Without this, a rollout farms
   ascent by re-attesting satisfied caps. (Suspected-bug flag from fan-out pilot #1, now a correctness
   requirement.) Test: an already-`:satisfied` produced cap contributes 0.
4. **Sweep, don't guess.** Run [[E-possible-world-regulator]] over the *whole field* (not just this
   snapshot) to pin a robust `:graph-off-map-penalty` (and body-mode); P≈4 is the snapshot estimate —
   verify it generalizes. (NB: hand-guessing weights was refuted earlier this session; the regulator
   exists for exactly this.)
5. **Apply live with consent.** Set the pinned values in `live-star-map-efe-opts`
   (futon3c `report/war_machine.clj`). The live EFE is the operator's consent locus.
6. **Tests.** `efe_test` for the off-map penalty (off-map action gets the penalty; on-map unchanged), the
   leaf-aware body (a big on-ascent mission no longer outranked by a small off-map one), and status-aware
   ascent (already-`:satisfied` cap contributes 0).

> **Flag (from the field-side contribution §3, point 4):** Track 1 fixes the *pragmatic* pole only. The
> additive `:G-gap` term is **provisional** — full-`C` (the substrate-2 epistemic field) becomes the macro
> where-prior and retires it (both-live-gated). Do **not** entrench `:G-gap` in the Track-1 fix or tune the
> off-map penalty *against* it as if permanent; once `C` lands, gap and `C` must not double-count "where."

### Track 2 — the policy layer (the forward-model contract)

A policy `π` is a sequence of leaves; `G(π)` accumulates per-step EFE (the Track-1-corrected credit)
over a rollout, discounted. The rollout needs a **transition model** — and fabricating one is the trap.

**The forward-model contract (the join to draft):** what the field and the arrows must each expose so a
rollout can consume them.
- **State** — from claude-3's substrate-2 / capability-graph (the geometry the rollout scores over).
- **Transition (arrow)** — from claude-4's M-memes-arrows-patterns-diagrams: `state × leaf → next-state`
  (which capability/hole-state a leaf advances to).
- **Per-step score** — the Track-1-corrected graph-EFE credit (advance-the-map, leaf-aware).
- **Rollout** — sequence of (state, leaf, next-state), discounted-`G` accumulation; `G(π)` vs greedy.

Drafting this contract so claude-3 and claude-4 converge on it is the move that gets Track 2 going; the
play-out engine is then a thin layer on top. **Do not build the rollout before the field + arrows land**
(fabricated dynamics = the regulator's lesson). The destination is the convergence
([[M-futonzero-capability]] §22): preference = the marking credit, policy = arrows/patterns,
simulator = substrate-2 field, reward = peradams.

#### Field-side contribution (claude-3, 2026-06-09 — the substrate-2/Salingaros/D2 lane)

claude-3 (the lane Track 2 depends on) supplied the field side of the contract. Five points, integrated:

1. **The two geometries are the two EFE poles, not competitors.** My capability-graph-EFE
   (applicability/body/ascent, Track 1) is the **PRAGMATIC pole** — advance the operator's registered
   ascent. The Salingaros/substrate-2 field (`C = T·(10−H)` over scopes; `L = T·H`) is the **EPISTEMIC
   pole + the named local structure** (the actual open holes). `G(π) = pragmatic(graph-ascent) +
   epistemic(substrate-2 C/holes)`. **Track 1 tunes the pragmatic pole; the rollout needs both.**
2. **The field is REAL now.** D1 of `M-mission-scopes-into-substrate-2` closed — 194 scope-trees +
   patterns/psr-pur in a **unified substrate-2**, computed from actual structure (open holes, attested
   PURs, `:detached` pattern-links), not invented dynamics. The concrete answer to the regulator's "the
   simulator must be real."
3. **The forward-model contract — field side:**
   - **State** = a substrate-2 scope-state (per region: which scope-holes open/closed; which patterns
     attested(PUR) vs near-miss/`:detached`).
   - **Per-step score** = `epistemic(C / open-hole entropy + open-pattern affordances) + pragmatic(L +
     my corrected graph-ascent)`.
   - **Transition** = claude-4's arrow: `state × leaf → next-state` (a leaf closes a hole / discharges a
     sorry / grafts a pattern → updates the scope-state). The field supplies the state-deltas; the arrows
     say which leaf causes which.
   - **The render IS the rollout substrate** — "show the EFE field on the Futon City map" (Joe) = the
     contract made visible.
4. **Gap-term retirement couples the two tracks.** Track 1 keeps the additive `:G-gap` *provisionally*.
   Full-`C` becomes the macro where-prior and **retires the additive gap-term** (both-live-gated, per the
   earlier salvo). So the field landing is also what lets Track 1's gap-term retire — **flag: don't let
   the Track-1 fix entrench `:G-gap`, and don't double-count "where" (gap AND C) once C lands.**
5. **Patterns-as-backdrop → patterns-as-policy is the Track-2 hinge.** D1's psr/pur/pxr records (attested
   applications + outcome + prediction-error) are the **labelled examples** grounding claude-4's arrows —
   the seed of the policy moves. "policy = patterns/arrows" is exactly the M-memes
   pattern→wiring-diagram→sorry moment.

**My alignment + the open contract question (belled to claude-3):** the two poles compose **additively**
into `G_step` (consistent with `compute-efe` already summing terms) — good. The open question is the
**state representation**: my pragmatic pole reads the *capability-graph* (missions→capabilities→goal
ascent, futon0 star-map); claude-3's state is the *substrate-2 scope-state* (holes/patterns). For one
rollout to score both poles, the unified state must carry both, and the arrow must update both jointly
(a leaf closes holes **and** attests capabilities). **Q for claude-3:** is the capability-graph already a
region/overlay inside the unified substrate-2 (D1), or does it need to be joined in? That join is the
contract's keystone. Field side builds the **epistemic pole first** (independent of my Track-1 graph-EFE
defects); composes with the corrected pragmatic pole once Track 1 lands.

#### Forward-model contract v1 — RESOLVED (claude-3 ↔ claude-1, 2026-06-09)

**State-rep keystone answered: ONE state object via a thin materialize+link, NOT a coupled pair.** The
hinge already exists by construction — D1 detected the substrate-2 capability-scopes by matching mission
text against the *same* `M-capability-star-map.graph.edn` `:capabilities` registry that `efe.clj` reads
as `:capability-graph`. So every capability-scope already names a real star-map capability; the
mission↔capability link is already in substrate-2 (the `.graph.edn` capability *nodes/ascent-edges* are
not yet materialized — that is the one small ingest claude-3 owns).

- **State `s`** = a substrate-2 snapshot, one object hinged on capability-scopes:
  - *epistemic part* = per-mission scope-hole set (open/closed + `:detached`).
  - *pragmatic part* = per-capability `{:status, :pre-registered?, :scope/parents}` — the materialized
    `.graph.edn` overlay over the shared mission nodes.
- **Per-step score `g(s)`** = `epistemic(C / open-holes)` + `pragmatic(Track-1-corrected graph-ascent)`.
  **Additive.** claude-1 bells the corrected pragmatic per-step; claude-3 composes it in.
- **Transition `T(s, leaf) → s'`** (claude-4's arrow) = leaf closes scope-hole(s) [epistemic] **and**, if
  it closes a *capability-scope*, flips that capability `:status → satisfied` [pragmatic, via the hinge].
  One arrow updates both edge-families jointly — no separate join object.
- **Rollout `G(π) = Σ discounted g(s_t)`** over `π = (leaf₁, leaf₂, …)`; `G(π)` vs greedy one-step is the
  **completion-criterion-4 witness.**

**The one requirement this puts on Track 1 (claude-1 owns):** the corrected pragmatic per-step must be
**status-aware** — `mission-ascent-progress` currently credits a mission for the capabilities it
`:produces` in the goal's transitive scope *without* checking whether they are already `:satisfied`. In a
rollout that flips capabilities to `:satisfied`, an already-satisfied capability must yield **zero**
further ascent-credit, else a policy farms ascent by re-attesting satisfied caps. (Flagged earlier in the
fan-out pilot #1 as a suspected bug; the rollout makes it a hard correctness requirement.) So Track 1's
deliverable to the field side = the off-map-penalised, leaf-aware **and status-aware** graph-ascent.

**Division of labour:** claude-3 owns materialize+link + the Futon City per-step-cost/metric field render
(epistemic pole built + screenshotted already — NB the *metric backdrop*, not "the EFE field"; the EFE
*figure* is the geodesic/path overlay, per the §1 path-functional note); claude-4 owns the arrows (grounded by D1's psr/pur/pxr labelled
examples); claude-1 owns the corrected status-aware pragmatic per-step (Track 1) + the rollout engine
once the field + arrows land.

**Status (2026-06-09) — materialize+link LANDED** (claude-3, `mission_scope_ingest.clj
--wire-capabilities`). 33 capabilities from `M-capability-star-map.graph.edn` materialized into
substrate-2 as `scope/capability/<cap-id>` nodes, **reusing D1's capability-scope endpoints** (the
by-construction hinge → one state object). Per node: `:capability/{status, pre-registered?, frontier?,
claimed?, minted-by}`; +13 ascent edges, +34 produces edges; 23 claimed / 10 unclaimed. **My status-aware
pragmatic per-step now reads `:capability/status` directly** (GET
`/api/alpha/entity/scope%2Fcapability%2F<cap-id>`); the transition flips it when a leaf closes the
capability-scope. The state side of the contract is delivered; the pragmatic per-step (Track 1) is the
remaining piece on my side.

**Render-side reframe ratified (claude-3, 2026-06-09).** The epistemic render is renamed to the
*per-step-cost / metric field* (substrate-2 `C` + `:detached` = the local metric); the star UI = ⭐/🌟
**endpoints over the metric** (an unclaimed ⭐ = an *unreachable endpoint* = the off-map-GOAL case — "same
insight, two views"). The *figure* will be the **geodesic**: selected policies drawn as trajectories
ranked by `G(π)`, not the heatmap. claude-3 also adopted the shared-kernel rule for the arrow wiring (`T`
IS the live transition). **The geodesic figure + the composed two-pole object are gated on Track-1's
status-aware pragmatic per-step** — i.e. Track 1 is now the critical path for all three lanes.

**Star UI LANDED (claude-3, 2026-06-09)** — `futon6/scripts/mission_efe_field.py → mission-efe-field.html`.
The metric field `g(s)` rendered as a **topographic map** (7 level bands + contour lines, not a smooth
blob — legible level sets: a central massif = the dense mission core, plus a secondary island). 🌟 claimed
capabilities sit on the terrain at their minting missions (link-lined); ⭐ unclaimed sit in a disconnected
**"frontier sky"** strip — *the off-map-GOAL / unreachable-endpoint made literally visual* (the
cold-outreach + KIT commercial cluster + the 3 aspirationals are all in the sky). The geodesic *figure*
(selected policies as streamlines) is the next layer, gated on Track-1's corrected per-step.

#### Transition layer — claude-4's arrow store (M-memes-arrows-patterns-diagrams, reviewed 2026-06-09)

claude-4's deliverable (`futon3a/README-memes-and-arrows.md`, INSTANTIATE H1-H6 complete) supplies the
contract's **transition `T`** — and it is richer than "a bare state-transition." An arrow is a
`(have, want)` endpoint pair at **three maturity stages** (one arrow gaining structure,
`correlation → conjecture → proof`):
- `:correlated` (cascade/hunch) — observed co-occurrence, no committed goal.
- `:open` (sorry) — goal committed, type fixed by the surrounding construction, **method absent**.
- `:constructed` — a runnable method that produces `want` from `have` (a wiring diagram / BHK arrow).

**Mapping onto the rollout** (this refines contract-v1's Transition clause):
- **`:constructed` arrows = available transitions** the rollout may traverse.
- **`:open` arrows = the needed-but-unbuilt transitions = the holes/leaves** a policy aims to close.
- **`:correlated` arrows = candidate hunches** (pre-commitment, not yet a leaf).
- **A rollout leaf = construct an `:open` arrow** whose `have` holds in the current state (promote
  `:open → :constructed`) → `want` becomes available **and** the arrow crosses into substrate-2. This IS
  claude-3's "`T` flips `:status → satisfied`": only `:constructed` arrows promote (the priors↔facts
  boundary, R7), and they land as `code/v05/sorry` hyperedges — the *same* scope-hole convention
  claude-3's epistemic state already reads. So a leaf closing an open arrow updates the epistemic state
  by construction.
- **Endpoint-identity keystone** (`(have, want)` primary key, unify-not-mint, I1+I4): the transition
  graph self-dedups — a freshly-mined sorry unifies onto its existing arrow rather than minting a dup.

**Storage split the rollout must respect:** the arrow store is `futon3a`/SQLite — the *proposals/priors*
layer where an arrow lives its life; substrate-2 (`futon1a`, :7071) holds only `:constructed` arrows +
scope-holes (the *facts*). So the rollout reads **both**: candidate leaves (`:open` arrows) from the meme
store, satisfied state from substrate-2.

**Open seam to resolve with claude-4 (the transition-side analogue of claude-3's state-rep keystone):**
the *epistemic* side aligns by construction (constructed arrows land as `code/v05/sorry` scope-holes).
The remaining question is the **pragmatic side**: does an arrow's `want` endpoint resolve onto a
*capability-graph cap-id* (so closing it advances ascent / flips `:capability/status`)? The example
endpoints are notion/scope-level; `meme.endpoints` already resolves against the live `scan-aif-heads`
registry. So either the `want↔cap-id` mapping already holds, or a thin endpoint→capability resolver is
needed (mirroring claude-3's materialize+link). **This is the next contract question before the rollout
engine can walk the arrows.**

**Seam RESOLVED — claude-1 ↔ claude-4 whistle salvo, 2026-06-09.** The three namespaces are *disjoint*
(star-map cap-ids · arrow `want` endpoints · scan-aif-heads ids) — verified, no lexical bridge — so a
blind `want→cap-id` resolver is out. Resolution = **declare-don't-guess**: the constructing leaf carries
the cap-id it advances.
- **Field:** `:advances-cap <cap-id>` on the arrow (a nullable `advances_cap` column) — OPTIONAL, stamped
  at construction by the **rollout leaf** (its pragmatic target, *never* inferred from the endpoint
  string). Absent ⇒ ordinary arrow: construct + cross to substrate-2 only, no ascent.
- **`promote!` (claude-4's layer), on `:open → :constructed`:** validate `advances_cap` against the
  `:7071` capability overlay (`GET /api/alpha/entity/scope%2Fcapability%2F<cap-id>`) — reject/flag loudly
  if unknown (no silent mislock) — then **route on the cap's class, read from the registry** (data-driven,
  not special-cased): `:capability/frontier? false` ⇒ ordinary ⇒ flip `:status → :satisfied` (the
  construction *is* the evidence); `:capability/frontier? true` ⇒ frontier ⇒ emit `:status :claimed`
  (🟡-pending) + a proposed-flip event, **never auto-satisfy**. *(NB `:pre-registered?` is `true` for
  both — `:frontier?` is the discriminator; verified `:agency` frontier?=false/`:satisfied`,
  `:ai-passes-prelims` frontier?=true/`:held`.)* Idempotent, keyed by `(endpoint-key, cap-id)`.
- **Layer split:** claude-4 = the `advances_cap` column + the `promote!` validate/route/write block;
  claude-1 = wire the rollout leaf to stamp `:advances-cap` + the status-aware per-step reads `:satisfied`;
  **claude-1/Dokusan = the witness gate that turns frontier `:claimed → :satisfied`** — `promote!` never
  closes a frontier cap.
- **Exactly-once loop:** construct flips `:satisfied` (write) ∧ status-aware per-step gives 0 credit for
  satisfied (read) ⇒ a leaf advances ascent exactly once, no farming.
- **New cross-lane contract:** claude-4's `promote!` now reads claude-3's `:7071` overlay as a *validation
  API* — `:capability/frontier?` + `:capability/status` + the `scope/capability/<id>` endpoint are a
  stable contract (FYI'd to claude-3; recorded in `futon3a/README` §4a on claude-4's side).
- **Build status:** claude-4's half (column + `promote!` block + a worked example) is specced +
  handoff-ready (codex-2 + claude-4 review, the H1–H6 pattern); **not on the immediate critical path** (I
  wire my halves after the Track-1 sweep). **GREENLIT as a warranted E-excursion (Joe, 2026-06-09)** —
  claude-4 owns it end-to-end (scope/name/dispatch-to-codex-2/review/land). **LANDED:
  `E-wm-policy-arrow-seam`, futon3a `9e9d446` "Wire meme arrows to capability ascent" (codex-2,
  claude-4-reviewed)** — touches `meme/{schema (advances_cap column), identity (promote! validate/route/
  write), cap_ascent (NEW — validate-against-:7071-overlay + ordinary-flip / frontier-proposed-flip), arrow,
  writer}` + a worked example. My halves (rollout leaf stamps `:advances-cap`; status-aware per-step reads
  `:satisfied`) integrate at the rollout-engine build.

### Prior art to port — `~/code/ukrn-services-simulation/` (reviewed 2026-06-09)

Joe's UKRN-services sim is AIF-based, Clojure/EDN, **zero external numeric deps** (`java.lang.Math` only)
— so its machinery ports cleanly into `efe.clj`. Honest finding: its EFE is *also* mostly single-step
per-tick (risk + ambiguity + pattern + budget + priority, composed each tick) — like our WM — **except**
the budget term, which is a genuine horizon rollout. That rollout is the gold.

- **The path-integral kernel: `project-budget-path`** (`notebooks/ukrn_v3_efe.clj:274-315`). A K-tick
  horizon loop (default K=4) that accumulates per-step cost, applies a periodic replenishment schedule,
  and has a sticky `:truncated` absorbing barrier. This **is** the `G(π) = Σ_t g(s_t)` accumulator we
  need — port the loop structure as the rollout engine's spine.
- **Shared-kernel pattern: `step-kernel`** (`notebooks/ukrn_v3_kernel.clj:235`). One `T(state, action) →
  next-state` is called by **both** the live step and the predictive rollout — so the simulator *cannot
  drift from reality*. This is the regulator's "the simulator must be real" lesson solved
  *structurally*. **Architectural port:** claude-4's arrow `T` should BE the same transition the live WM
  uses, not a parallel sim. (Ties to our [[E-possible-world-regulator]] no-fabricated-dynamics rule.)
- **Belief update: `update-mu`** (`notebooks/ukrn_v3_belief.clj:12-40`) — Gaussian precision-weighted
  predictive-coding; standard, portable, if we make states probabilistic.
- **Selection: softmax + abstain** (`notebooks/ukrn_v3_efe.clj:599`) — `P(a) ∝ exp(−G/τ)` with an
  abstain guard when top candidates are indiscriminable. *Not* geodesic, but a principled
  policy-sampler; the abstain-on-low-discriminability guard maps onto WM-I4 (don't act when the field is
  flat).
- **Term templates:** `risk-term-v3` / `ambiguity-term-v3` (`ukrn_v3_efe.clj:233-252`) — pragmatic
  (goal-distance) + epistemic (entropy) decomposition, drop-in shape for our two-pole `g(s)`.

**Port plan (Track 2):** lift `project-budget-path`'s loop as the rollout spine; generalise its per-step
cost from "engagement cost" to our `g(s) = epistemic(C) + pragmatic(corrected graph-ascent)`; drive it
with claude-4's arrow as the `step-kernel`; select policies by softmax-over-`G(π)` with the abstain
guard. All pure-Clojure, no new deps.

## 4. ARGUE

### Open ARGUE finding — three kinds of off-map (claude-3 ↔ claude-1, 2026-06-09)

The off-map treatment distinguishes **three kinds, needing different handling** (refined from the original
two when claude-3 placed the unclaimed goal-endpoints in the metric):
- **off-map WORK** (a candidate mission not on the capability graph) → **penalise** (Track 1's off-map
  penalty — it doesn't advance a registered destination).
- **off-map GOAL / summit** (a pre-registered cap that `:scope`-builds on a *claimed* ascent-parent — e.g.
  `full-arxiv-mining`, `wm-overnight-unsupervised`, `ai-passes-prelims`) → **reachable**: a geodesic *can*
  run to it from the claimed substrate below. Finite distance-to-goal; a normal ascent target, just high
  up. Place it on the map above its substrate (dashed link).
- **off-map GOAL / island** (a pre-registered cap with *no claimed anchor anywhere* — the entire `kit-*` +
  `cold-*` commercial cluster; `cold-response-conversion` has **zero edges**) → **unreachable**: distance =
  ∞, **no path exists**. Generates no ascent-gradient (the flat-field problem) — it **cannot be aimed at**
  until terrain is constructed. Surface as **"needs a foothold,"** and treat *constructing the foothold* as
  the first (meta-)leaf — not as a target the per-step scores toward.

**Reachability ⟂ witness-class.** The summit/island axis (can a geodesic run?) is *orthogonal* to the
`:frontier?` axis (promote!'s witness gate). Verified: both `cold-response-conversion` (island) and
`wm-overnight-unsupervised` (summit) are `:frontier? true`. Keep them separate: reachability is the
rollout's concern; `:frontier?` is promote!'s routing.

**Island foothold — route (a), design-pattern-embed (Joe's lean; aligned, build held for operator go).**
Write the commercial cluster as a *design-pattern* and embed it in the same MiniLM space as
patterns+missions. Its job is to **seed candidate `:open` arrows** (M-memes `h4` similarity-join:
similar+co-occurring+no-construction → seeded open sorries) = *conjectural terrain*. Then the rollout's
distance-to-goal is the **path-length over those seeded arrows**, not the raw cosine (the embed seeds
terrain; the path-metric measures it). The path is low-confidence (`:open`/`:correlated`, conjectural),
labelled distinct from a summit's claimed-substrate path. Rejected route (b) — a `:real-mission? false`
stub mission — as fabricating a path prematurely (the cluster is unclaimed *because* it has no defined
path). **Drop-in:** route (a) IS the transition contract above — the seeded arrows are claude-4's arrows;
constructing one toward an island carries `:advances-cap <island-cap>`; island caps are `:frontier?` →
`promote!` routes them to `:claimed`/witness. No new mechanism. *Build of route (a) creates an artifact +
touches commercial/income strategy (M-futon-forward-model) → operator go before building.*

### VERIFY / INSTANTIATE

**Track 1 — INSTANTIATE done (regulator sweep + operator-consented live-apply, 2026-06-09).**

Regulator sweep over the live snapshot (efe.clj reloaded), `:leaf` + status-aware on, varying `P`:

| P | cursor | M-capability-star-map | M-essay-corpus (leaf) | M-futonzero-mvp | M-EOI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **1** | 18 | 21 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 3 | **1** | **2** | 4 | 10 |
| 6 | 9 | **1** | **2** | 14 | 16 |
| 8 | 14 | **1** | **2** | 18 | 19 |

Findings: (1) the **off-map penalty is the load-bearing knob** — at `P=0` (leaf+status-aware on, no
penalty) the cursor is still #1; leaf-body/status-aware fix the on-map *ordering*, the penalty closes the
*escape hatch*. (2) At any `P≥4` the live top flips to on-ascent work (#1 `M-capability-star-map`, #2
`M-essay-corpus-substrate` leaf), stable. (3) **The penalty is blunt** — it can't distinguish the *silly*
off-map cursor from *valuable-but-unwired* off-map work (`M-futonzero-mvp` moves down *with* the cursor);
no `P` isolates the cursor. **The real lever for unwired-valuable work is wiring it onto the graph** — the
penalty correctly creates that incentive (the ARGUE principle). **`P=4` chosen** (operator) as the gentlest
setting that flips the headline with least collateral (futonzero-mvp stays #4; residual: cursor at #3, no
longer the recommendation).

Live-apply: `live-star-map-efe-weights` (war_machine.clj `c13b5e2`) →
`{:graph-off-map-penalty 4.0, :graph-body-mode :leaf, :graph-ascent-status-aware? true}`; `efe` +
`war-machine` reloaded via Drawbridge (behavior-preserving by default; the new opts are the change). The
in-process rollout under the new live opts confirms **cursor → #3, `M-capability-star-map` #1**. The served
judgement (`!wm-snapshot`, scheduler period 300s) refreshes on the next tick (triggered async via
`request-tick!`). NB the live JVM now runs the reloaded `efe`/`war-machine`; a JVM restart would reload
from the (committed) branch files.

**Track 2 — the rollout engine LANDED + reviewed-pass + independently verified (2026-06-09).** The search
half of the AlphaZero loop now exists and the witness passes.
- **Shas:** futon2 `65f137d` "Add policy rollout engine" (`futon2.aif.rollout` + `rollout_test.clj` +
  witness `holes/labs/e-rollout-witness.clj`); futon3a `2122daf` "Extract pure meme transition step"
  (`src/meme/step.clj` — the MUST-A shared pure kernel). Codex-authored, **claude-4-reviewed** (traced).
- **claude-1 independent verification (the real gate, not a rubber-stamp — what I ran):**
  - `rollout-test`: **3 tests / 9 assertions / 0 failures.**
  - Full futon2 suite: **326 / 1004, 1 failure** = the *same pre-existing* `sorry-registry` red (was 323/1;
    the 3 new rollout tests added cleanly — **no new regression**).
  - **Witness (independent lab run):** greedy one-step `G = −0.2` vs **2-step rollout `G = −1.0`** — the
    multi-step policy (`root→bridge`, `bridge→agency`, where step-1 unlocks step-2's `have`) **beats greedy**,
    which greedy can't see. **This is the proof policy-EFE works.**
  - **MUST-A ✓** live-plan-target `:claimed` = sim-target `:claimed` (same `meme.step/step` kernel, no drift).
  - **MUST-B ✓** rollout write-count = **0** (zero `:7071` writes during search — the safety invariant holds).
  - `:move/terminal?` carried + truncated (centre-mess); consumes the real 19-move stub honoring
    `:conjectural` reachability; PUCT-prior branching (R1) + threaded `:move/id` return-channel (R2).
- **State:** the SEARCH half is live against claude-3's stub. The full loop needs claude-3's real grad-loop
  producer (building in parallel) as the live prior, + v2 (the return channel — claude-4 emits realized
  `G(π)`-per-`:move/id` back to train the prior, on demand). **Gated on operator merge** (branch
  `wm-outing/2026-06-08-regulator-sweep`).
- Still open: route-(a) island-foothold (aligned, build held for operator go).

### Make-it-live plan — value-correction + cascade-surfacing (2026-06-09)

Joe's framing: a next-step is a **degenerate (length-1) policy**, so the rollout *generalizes* the live
selector rather than replacing it — and he wants to **see** non-degenerate policies, not have them collapse
back into a re-ranked single action. Two layers:
- **(A) Value-correction (the floor):** `generate-war-machine` scores each candidate by `G(π*)` = best
  policy starting with it; length-1 = today's single-step EFE (always-available fallback).
- **(B) Cascade-surfacing (the *visible* non-degenerate policies):** a **cascade** = `:correlated` chain
  (`arrowᵢ.want == arrowᵢ₊₁.have`); `π = "use a cascade"` is a ready-made multi-step policy (no
  search-from-scratch). The rollout scores `G(π)` over the *given* chain (the accumulator already does this);
  the WM **displays** top cascade-policies as their own lane.

**claude-4's empirical findings (scoping whistle):**
- **Store is empty of cascades** — live `meme.db` has 1 arrow; worked-example seeds were transient. So (B)
  needs a **generation step 0**. Real source found: `pattern_phylogeny`'s **2538 co-application edges**
  (mission-co-occurring pattern-pairs = ready `:correlated` arrows; co-app weight = the prior). Single arrows
  first; chains emerge as paths over the co-app graph.
- **Chain-follow unroll** = DFS over `:correlated` edges from each root `have`; single-arrow = length-1,
  maximal path = the length-K non-degenerate policy; surface top-`G(π)`.
- **Namespace flag (a design fork):** cascades live over **pattern-ids**, the value-corrected candidates over
  **mission/scope-ids** → (B) is a **distinct "pattern-cascade policy" lane** shown *alongside* the
  value-corrected mission actions, not conflated. (That separation is what makes the non-degenerate policy
  visible *as its own thing*.)

**Build order / ownership:** (0) batch-gen cascades from `pattern_phylogeny` → `:correlated` arrows ·
(1) chain-extraction `cascades-as-candidate-policies` · (2) rollout scores `G(π)` per cascade — **claude-4**
(codex + review, charter `E-cascade-policies` or extend `E-policy-rollout-engine`); (3) wire into
`generate-war-machine` + the dual-lane display — **claude-1** (holds the live-judge context). MUST-B holds
(scoring sim-only; `:correlated` arrows never promoted during scoring).

### The policy framework — a cascade is an on-the-fly pattern-semilattice (Joe, 2026-06-09; SUPERSEDES the stored-chain plan)

The stored-chain reading above is the *degenerate, linear* case. The real object (Joe):
- **A cascade is constructed *on-the-fly* for a circumstance** — Christopher Alexander's original name for a
  Pattern Language. It is precisely **the ARGUE move**: "what patterns make the case for *this* design?"
  Every mission's ARGUE phase already constructs one; we make it a first-class, scored object. The
  `pattern_phylogeny` is the **prior** (what tends to combine), not the cascade itself.
- **A policy is a SEMILATTICE of patterns, not a sequence** (Alexander, *A City is Not a Tree* — patterns
  overlap, they don't nest in a tree). So the rollout's linear `G(π)=Σγ^t g(s_t)` is the *linearized*
  degenerate case; the real `G(π)` is a **wholeness-functional over the semilattice** = Joe's "any more, too
  complicated; any less, not expressive enough" = **Salingaros `C = T·(10−H)`** (expressiveness `T` vs
  parsimony `H`). **claude-3's epistemic metric `C` *is* the cascade-scoring, one scale up.**
- **Each pattern is itself a policy** → policies compose recursively; "move" and "policy" are the same kind
  of thing at different grains.
- **The bra `⟨ψ|` (the circumstance) is heterogeneous and extensible** — `⟨ψ=mission|`, `⟨ψ=scope|`, … i.e.
  **substrate-2's node-types** (the unified state already holds scope/mission/capability/pattern/PSR). Moves
  are an **extensible operator-registry over that state** (not the fixed 4 `:move/class`) — find-a-messy-
  mission · run-a-cascade-over-a-scope · match-a-pattern-across-missions · annotate-a-PSR · … — and they
  **compose across ψ-types**. (That extensible operator-space is the **M-aif2 extensible-registry /
  niche-construction** primitive — the make-it-live work and aif2 converge here.)
- **Complexity is expressible but NOT rewarded** (Joe): the `C`/wholeness score selects the *simplest
  adequate* policy for the circumstance — Occam via `C`. A very-complex composed policy is *representable*
  but would usually score *low* (too complicated). So the policy-space is rich; the scoring keeps it honest.

**Notation (Joe, refined):** patterns/policies are **operators**, missions/scopes are the **state-vectors**
`|ψ⟩` they act on — a cascade is a product `O₃O₂O₁|ψ⟩`, scored by the wholeness of the result. (Container
stays **M-wm-policies**; a **Campaign** spanning WM + aif2 + differentiable-substrate may be registered
later. For now: **experiments, not formalism.**)

**Experiment menu (candidate useful policies — affordances, not constraints; simple → composed →
self-improving):**
1. *Discharge-the-readiest-sorry* — `|ψ=open sorry, have satisfied⟩` → BHK-construction pattern →
   `:open→:constructed`. (pudding-prover; simplest useful non-degenerate move — it *completes*.)
2. *Clean-a-mess* (the seed) — `|ψ=low-coherence district / messy mission⟩` → mission-coherence cascade →
   raise `C`. (Futon City + `C`.)
3. *Unblock-then-do* — `|ψ=mission blocked by an unbuilt dependency⟩` → discharge dependency, then mission.
   (The canonical non-degenerate policy greedy can't see — the witness shape.)
4. *Walk-an-ascent* — `|ψ=on-ascent mission w/ claimed substrate⟩` → leaf-chain from substrate to a summit
   cap (wm-overnight / ai-passes-prelims). (Star map + rollout.)
5. *Propagate-a-win* — clean a mission → find another using the same pattern (co-application) → annotate its
   PSR. (Joe's cross-ψ composition; phylogeny + PSR surface.)
6. *Mint-a-peradam* — `|ψ=mission near a 3-witness certificate⟩` → complete labor+arrow+fruit → mint.
   (Ties policies to the reward.)
7. *Canalize-a-proven-pattern* — `|ψ=pattern applied across missions⟩` → EXPLORE→ASSIMILATE→CANALIZE → a
   new library operator. (**Policies that extend the operator-registry = aif2 niche-construction — the
   deepest one: policies that create policies.**)

**The seed already exists: E-warranted-play = the length-1 cascade** (given a mission, select ONE pattern,
apply it — the selector built this session). So we **generalize E-warranted-play (1-pattern) → small
pattern-semilattice**, scored by `C`, growing the operator-registry as real circumstances demand it
(niche-construction, not big-design-up-front). Spectrum: `1 pattern (E-warranted-play) → small semilattice
→ full ARGUE-grade language for a hard design`.

**Proposed concrete seed (claude-1):** take a *real messy mission* (e.g. `interim-director-proxy-metric-
inventory`, ~29 open holes), construct the **mission-coherence cascade** (a small pattern-semilattice) over
it on-the-fly, score it by `C` (show the too-much/too-little knee biting on real data), surface it in the WM
as a *visible non-degenerate policy*. Smallest thing that demonstrates a *grown* policy + the scoring
discriminating — and it's Joe's own first example.

### Track 2 — the rollout engine (DERIVE, 2026-06-09)

**G1 reconciliation with `M-differentiable-substrate` (claude-3) — the AlphaZero split** *(proposed, to
ratify with the gradient-route owner before either builds; resolves that mission's G1 + success-criterion-3).*
`M-differentiable-substrate` builds a **second route to `G(π)`**: a gradient over the materialised metric
(`grad(loss)(A)` = ranked edit-proposals = the differentiable geodesic — the `code_diff_jax_pilot` /
`jax_refine` port, already numerically healthy on code). Its G1 asks how that relates to my discrete
rollout. Resolution:
- **The gradient route is the POLICY PRIOR; the discrete rollout is the SEARCH** — exactly AlphaZero. The
  gradient pass is fast, global, *first-order*: it ranks candidate moves (which single edits descend the
  metric toward goal-anchors). The rollout is deliberate, *multi-step*: it takes the gradient's top-k
  proposed moves as its **branching set** and evaluates actual **paths** (`G(π)` over sequences), capturing
  the combinatorial structure a first-order gradient misses (a move bad alone but good as step-1 of a path).
- So: **gradient = prior over moves (policy net) · rollout = lookahead over paths (MCTS) · value = `G(π)` ·
  reward = peradam.** They compose as prior+search, not competitors — G1 options (b)+(c) (the gradient
  *seeds* the move-set / is the continuous *relaxation* the rollout discretises).
- **Cross-check (a) as a diagnostic:** where the gradient's first-order ranking disagrees with the
  rollout's path-integral ranking = signal (combining-methods-as-diagnostic) — a move the gradient likes
  but the rollout finds dead-ends, or a path the local gradient couldn't see.

**Engine design** (inputs all landed; refined by claude-4's ratification 2026-06-09):
- **Forward-model `step(state, leaf) → state'`** — **MUST-A (shared pure kernel, not a mirror):** refactor
  `promote!`'s transition into ONE pure `step` that *both* the live path and the sim call — single source,
  cannot drift (vs a mirror that can). **MUST-B (copy-state, no `:7071` writes in the rollout):** the sim
  takes the cap-overlay as an *input snapshot* and returns an updated *copy* — it must **never** mutate a
  real cap during simulation, else a K-step rollout launders frontier caps at scale. Only the **selected
  policy's first step** applies live (claude-4's dry-run discipline becomes the rollout's foundation).
- **Accumulator** — port ukrn `project-budget-path`'s K-step loop: `G(π) = Σ_t γ^t g(s_t)` over
  `π = (leaf₁ … leaf_K)`, discounted, with absorbing barriers.
- **Per-step `g(s)`** = epistemic(`C`/holes, claude-3) + pragmatic(Track-1-corrected graph-ascent, live).
- **Move-set** = the gradient prior's top-k (`M-differentiable-substrate`), or — until that lands —
  **(Add-C)** the canonical fallback: an open arrow is reachable iff its `have` is reached by some
  `:constructed` arrow (endpoint-graph reachability, computable from the store); the gradient top-k is the
  prior *over that reachable set*.
- **Barriers — (Add-D):** an `:advances-cap` at a *frontier* cap with no constructed path = "an endpoint
  with no terrain" = an absorbing barrier the rollout can't close — it needs a *minting charter*, not a leaf
  (wires the §4 three-kinds-of-off-map / island finding into the geodesic).
- **Selection** — argmin `G(π)` (the geodesic) / softmax+abstain (ukrn `select-action`; abstain on
  indiscriminable policies = WM-I4). The selected policies = the geodesics claude-3's render draws.
- **Witness — (Add-E):** a 2-step where step-1 *satisfies the `have`* of a high-ascent step-2 that
  greedy-one-step can't see — the cleanest "policy beats greedy," exercising the transition chain directly.

**Ownership (Joe, 2026-06-09):** claude-1 coordinates · **claude-4 owns the rollout** (`futon2.aif.rollout`,
its next E-excursion — codex handoff + claude-4 review, the seam pattern; MUST-A refactors claude-4's own
`promote!`) · **claude-3 owns the gradient route** (`M-differentiable-substrate` = the policy prior).

**Rollout CHARTERED (claude-4, 2026-06-09):** `E-policy-rollout-engine`
(`futon2/holes/E-policy-rollout-engine.md`) — scopes `futon2.aif.rollout` to the locked contract (MUST-A
shared pure kernel · MUST-B copy-state/zero-`:7071`-writes/only-selected-first-step-live · project-budget-path
accumulator · per-step epistemic(C)+pragmatic(status-aware ascent) · superset-snapshot-consumed-once + moving
reachable mask · argmin/softmax+abstain · Add-D frontier-no-path absorbing barrier · witness = ≥2-step beats
greedy). Build (codex handoff + claude-4 review) is **gated on claude-3's stub**
(`futon6/data/diffsub-moves-stub.edn`); claude-4 dispatches to codex when the stub lands and bells shas on
landing. MUST-A is intra-futon3a (claude-4's own `promote!` → shared pure `step`), no cross-repo
coordination. Charter ratifies the interface as-locked — no further changes from claude-4.

**R1/R2 accepted into the charter (claude-4):** search expands `:prior`-weighted (renormalized over
reachable survivors; top-k = truncation only; `:prior` = policy head, `G(π)` = backed-up value; root
selection stays argmin/softmax+abstain); `:move/id` threaded stably per-leaf for the v2 return channel
(v1 forward-only). `:have`/`:want` confirmed as **full scope-ids** (claude-4's reachability join). **Two
gates before codex dispatch:** (i) **`:centre-mess`** — **RESOLVED** (claude-3 ↔ claude-4, futon6
`b8564fb`, claude-3's gap G6): every move now carries **`:move/terminal?`** (true on `:centre-mess` — the
only non-atomic class, a compound cluster graph-rewrite whose mechanism is M-memes; false on the other 18),
meaning "no expansion through it." claude-4's impl choice — hard-skip (not in branching set) or terminal
leaf carrying its g-cost (claude-3 leans the latter, to preserve the diffuse-disorder signal in the
policy); both honor no-fabricated-`T` and keep the stub valid. v2 promotes `:centre-mess` to a real
single-step `T` once its state-delta is defined (e.g. "reduces the district's open-hole-entropy by X").
(ii) **operator go** — claude-4 flagged an autonomy/leash question to Joe and awaits his call before
dispatching the codex build. **This is now the *only* remaining gate.** On it clearing, claude-4 dispatches
+ reviews + bells the shas.

**Operator GO given (Joe, 2026-06-09) — both builds dispatched in parallel (codex pool codex-1..4 open).**
Two framing corrections from Joe:
- **The two routes are NOT a cross-check — they are the two *required* halves of the AlphaZero featureset**
  (gradient prior ‖ rollout search); both are needed, not redundant. Disagreement-as-diagnostic is a minor
  side-benefit, not the rationale for two routes.
- **Consumer confirmed — not architecture-ahead-of-need.** The overnight WM runs **now** with
  **E-warranted-play as the default policy** (a live baseline); `M-wm-policies` (the rollout) lets it
  *explore the benefits of different policies and improve within a run*. So the rollout is a measurable
  improvement on a live capability, with the witness (≥2-step beats greedy) as the proof it helps.

Parallelization: claude-4 grabs a codex for the rollout build; claude-3 grabs a codex for the grad-loop
producer (concurrent, not serialized behind the stub); claude-1 coordinates.
Ratified by claude-4 (split + interface + DERIVE, conditional on MUST-A/B — accepted) **and claude-3**
(gradient side; `M-differentiable-substrate` IDENTIFY→DERIVE, contract in its §3.1).

**Move-set interface — LOCKED (claude-3 ↔ claude-4 ↔ claude-1, 2026-06-09).**
- claude-3's gradient **emits a static snapshot artifact** (scored moves + `:emit/metric` snapshot,
  consumed once) — a ranked move-set over the **full candidate space** (NOT just currently-reachable).
  Canonical move shape (minimal core `{:have :want :score :prior}` sorted by `:score` desc; full move):
  ```clojure
  {:move/id "<have>-><want>"  :move/class :close-hole|:graft-pattern|:advance-capability|:centre-mess
   :have "scope/<id>"  :want "scope/<id>|scope/capability/<id>"  :advances-cap "<cap-id>"|nil
   :score <f>  :prior <softmax∈[0,1]>  :delta-g <first-order Δ>
   :confidence :claimed-substrate|:conjectural  :rank <int>}
  ```
  `:advances-cap` = the cap-overlay read-contract hook (claude-4's `promote!` routes on
  `:capability/frontier?`/`:status`, unchanged); `:delta-g` = claude-3's first-order number, so its `:rank`
  is comparable to the rollout's path-rank (the cross-check); `:confidence :conjectural` flags
  not-yet-reachable / island moves; claude-4's `{:leaf/edit}` maps to `:move/class` + `(have, want)`.
- claude-4's rollout **consumes it once** (zero mid-search dependency on claude-3 or `:7071`) and applies a
  **moving reachable mask** per node — intersect with the *currently*-reachable set, renormalize. The key
  insight (claude-3): the prior must cover the **superset**, because *constructing an arrow mid-rollout opens
  new reachable `:have`s*, so moves that are only legal deeper in the path must already be scored. **Prior =
  a function over the candidate space; the rollout supplies the moving reachable mask.**
- The return channel (training the gradient from rollout outcomes) is strictly **post-search**.
- **Stub unblock — LANDED + verified (futon6 `38eb583`, 2026-06-09):** `futon6/data/diffsub-moves-stub.edn`
  — 19 moves, valid EDN, locked shape confirmed by claude-1: 3 summits (`full-arxiv-mining`,
  `wm-overnight-unsupervised`, `ai-passes-prelims`) as `:claimed-substrate` with real cap-ids + real
  ascent-parents; 9 `kit-*`/`cold-*` islands as `:conjectural` via `scope/conjectural/<x>-foothold` tails;
  plus hole-close / graft-pattern / centre-mess moves (`:advances-cap nil`). claude-4 builds + tests its
  rollout consumer against this *real contract* immediately; claude-3 builds the grad-loop producer behind it
  (same output shape, so the consumer won't move).

**Two refinements that make it the *full* AlphaZero loop (claude-3, R1+R2):**
- **R1 — `:prior` is the PUCT branching weight, not just a top-k cut.** AlphaZero's policy head outputs
  `P(s,a)` over actions; MCTS uses it as the PUCT prior. So `:prior = softmax(:score)` over the set, and the
  rollout uses `:prior` as its **branching weight** (top-k is mere truncation). The rollout's search is
  prior-weighted, not uniform over the top-k.
- **R2 — reserve the return channel (the loop closes).** In AlphaZero the *search result trains the policy
  net*. Stable `:move/id` lets claude-4's rollout report **realized `G(π)` per move** back as the training
  target for claude-3's gradient loss → the prior becomes **learnable from rollout outcomes, not static**;
  **`reward = peradam` enters here.** **v1 is forward-only** (prior→search); just keep `:move/id` stable so
  v2 can close the loop (prior→search→train-prior). This is the piece that makes it the full loop, not a
  one-way pipeline.

**Build scope** (codex handoff *after* the G1 reconciliation is ratified): a futon2 ns `futon2.aif.rollout`
— `step` (pure forward-model) · `rollout`/`G-of-policy` (accumulator) · `select-policy`. Test = a ≥2-step
rollout beats the greedy one-step on a constructed case (success-criterion-4). Gated on: reconciliation
ratified + the move-set source pinned.

### PSR / PUR
- **PSR (Track 1 fix):** Pattern: `logic-model-before-code` (verify the design over the live trace before
  coding) + the ARGUE "advance-the-map" principle. Alternatives considered: thread `:capability-graph`
  into opts (refuted — already there); raise ascent-weight only (insufficient — body still swamps).
  Rationale: the off-map escape + body-granularity are the two terms actually inverting the ranking,
  shown on live numbers. Confidence: high (demonstrated sandboxed).
- **PUR:** _pending implementation + sweep._
