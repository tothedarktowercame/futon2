(ns futon2.aif.fold-realized
  "PRODUCER of the R16→R14 `:realized-outcome` trace — the enactor side of the
   close-the-loop ↔ precision-over-policies seam (E-close-the-loop ×
   E-precision-over-policies, contract committed with claude-11, 2026-06-26).

   When a fold's `:wiring` is ENACTED (`apply-cascade!`) and we re-observe, this
   builds the record γ reads next tick:

     {:policy <id> :expected-G <g> :realized-G <g'> :tick <enactment tick>}

   Both G legs are the SAME EFE quantity — the fold's coverage→rollout ΔG
   (`futon2.aif.fold-eval`) — evaluated over the PREDICTED wiring (`:expected-G`,
   = the `:delta-g` the act-gate consumed at decision time) vs the actually-
   ENACTED wiring (`:realized-G`, recomputed post-enactment: holes filled / boxes
   failed ⇒ different coverage). So γ's relative error is apples-to-apples, not a
   ΔG-vs-ΔF mismatch. The reader is `policy-precision/fold-realized-outcome`.

   STAGED (no-live-pilot-edit discipline; the 2026-06-26 incident): enactment is
   NOT wired yet (Joe's call on touching the recovered pilot). `*live-wire?*`
   defaults false ⇒ `with-realized-outcome` returns the judge-output UNCHANGED ⇒
   `trace-record` emits no `:realized-outcome` key ⇒ γ holds at the prior 1.0
   (reduction-safe). The PURE `realized-outcome-of` is always available for the
   end-to-end judge→trace→γ integration test claude-11 wires.

   Pure + no I/O + no loop + flag-gated: `fold.clj`'s expected-only invariant is
   untouched (this ns is the OBSERVE-side producer, not a fold-contract term)."

(defn realized-outcome-of
  "PURE: the R16→R14 `:realized-outcome` record for an enacted decision.
     `decision`       — carries `:policy` and the expected leg: either an explicit
                        `:expected-G`, or `:fold` (the fold output, whose `:delta-g`
                        the gate consumed).
     `enacted-wiring` — the post-enactment wiring (`:boxes`/`:policy-holes`);
                        `:realized-G` = the SHARED coverage→rollout ΔG over it.
     `tick`           — the enactment tick (γ dedups on it).
   `:realized-G` is nil when nothing was enacted (no boxes) — γ then holds (it
   requires a number), the honest no-op.

   SCALE-MATCH PIN (claude-10 review must-fix, 2026-07-02): `:expected-G`
   PREFERS the fold's coverage-ΔG leg whenever present — never a gate-side
   rollout-G — because `:realized-G` is always coverage-ΔG, and a rollout-vs-
   coverage pair would feed γ the same scale-mismatched junk class that pinned
   it at 0.5 (the retired v0 feed). The gate still verdicts on its own
   reconciled leg; only γ's calibration pair is constrained here, at the
   contract, so no future caller can reintroduce the mismatch."
